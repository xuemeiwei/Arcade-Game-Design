# Classic Arcade Game Clone

## Description

This project is to develop a game that has a Player and Enemies(Bugs). The goal of the palyer is to reach the water without colliding into any enemy. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start position. Once the player reaches the water the player won.
